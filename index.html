    <h1> What is Lorem Ipsum? </h1>
    <p> <strong> Lorem Ipsum </strong> is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting <br> 
    industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy <br>
    text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley <br>
    of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has <br>
    survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic <br>
    typessetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in <br> 
    the 1960s with the release of Letrased sheets containing Lorem <br> 
    Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing <br>
    software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum. </p>

    <h2> Where does it come from? </h2>
    <p> Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. <br>
    It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, <br>
    making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin <br>
    professor at Hampden-Sydney Collage in Virginia, looked up one of <br> 
    the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum <br>
    passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical <br>
    literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum <br>
    comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of de <q> de Finibus Bonorum <br> 
    et Malorum</q> ( The Extrames of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in <br>
    45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular <br>
    during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, <q> Lorem <br>
    ipsum dolor sit amet.. </q> , comes from a line in section 1.10.32. </p>
    <p> The standard chunk of lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is <br>
    reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and <br>
    1.10.33 from <q> de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum</q> by Cicero are also <br>
    reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English <br>
    versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.  </p>

    <h3> Why do we use it? </h3>
    <p> It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the <br>
    readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of <br>
    using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution <br>
    of letters, as opposed to using ' Content here, content here ', <br>
    making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing <br>
    packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their <br> 
    default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover <br>
    many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved <br>
    over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose <br>
    (injected homour and the like) </p>
